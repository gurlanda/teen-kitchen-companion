  Teen Kitchen Project during summer of 2021. There is so much to learn
  about cooking and I'm grateful for all that I've learned. I am a rising
  senior at Pajaro Valley High School who has been elected as Class
  President. On my spare time I enjoy to sew clothing for myself, my mom,
  and for our two cats!"`,
