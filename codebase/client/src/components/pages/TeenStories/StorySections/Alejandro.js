  School and I enjoy to play soccer with my friends. I hope to be an
  engineer in the future when I apply to University of California,
  Berkeley. On the side, I love to cook meals for my family and reached
  out to Teen Kitchen Project to expand my skills as a chef. I hope you
  all enjoy the food I make!"`,
